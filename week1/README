Hi, all!

So, included in this zip file are the files we worked on in class, as well as the image of the website I want you to build.

Focus on the structure of the HTML, make sure the indentations look correct -- code is art. Remember that! You are all artists and the web is your canvas. Right now, we're working with those big chunky crayons -- hone them, get good at HTML and writing it cleanly, using my document as a guide. We will make it look prettier, I promise.

If you have questions, ask! If you're shy, ask me on direct message!

See you all next Tuesday!

Best,

Jason Noxon
